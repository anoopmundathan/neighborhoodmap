## Neighborhood Map Project

This Project is part of Udacity Front End Nano Degree Course.

This App displays my favourite locations around the London.

### Getting started
Open the index.html to view the application from src or dist folder.
Application is responsive to devices.
On Mobile format, click on the hamburger menu to open the list. Clicking on the location or the 'close' link will close the menu
Open /js/app.js to see the ViewModel

####Functionality covered against rubric

1. App has a Search Bar, List View, and Map
1. The Search bar allows to filter the locations. List View and Map shows the filtered locations as per the query on the Search Bar
1. Clicking on the List View, or the Marker on the map centers the map to this location, animates the marker, and pops open the info window.
1. Info Window pops with Forsquare review details (Ajax request) about the place marker that has been clicked.
1. Code has been separated based on MVVM best practises and avoiding updating the DOM manually. Code uses obervables instead.
1. In Model, all locations are hard coded in JSON format.
1. Application utilizes Google's Map API in a synchronous manner
1. Code is ready for personal review and is neatly formatted with comments where appropriate
